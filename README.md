# Arduino Karaoke

This repository contains all the code for my TEJ3M (Computer Engineering) Summative Project, completed in January 2025.

The circuit includes an LCD dislaying lyrics and two piezo buzzers, utilizing the Arduino Uno Rev3's timers to digitally write different pitches and play polyphonic songs. The code is written through the Arduino IDE.
